Physical rehabilitation therapy allows people with a physical disability to recover and improve their quality of life. Those people might have suffered or may be at risk of suffering pain, injuries and disorders due to accidents, ageing or environmental and genetic factors \autocite{american2011today}. Physical rehabilitation therapy includes repetitions of a set of exercises, resulting in undesired effects on patients, such as a lack of motivation and condition worsening. Moreover, motivation is a key factor in physical rehabilitation since it may contribute to treatment completion \autocite{Shelton2015}. Thus, developing digital games for physical rehabilitation treatments has become relevant as a strategy to increase patients' motivation \autocite{Brokaw2015,Burke2009,Hernandez2013,McNeill2012,PirovanoAdvisor2012}. In this research work, those games are called \acp{PREG}.

On the other hand, \ac{PX} denotes the personal experience of of a player when playing digital games, thereby involving his/her subjective perceptions \autocite{Chu2011,Wiemeyer2016}. \ac{PX} is one of the most significant factors in determining the success of digital games in terms of fun, flow, enjoyment, engagement, satisfaction, pleasure and playability. Thus, evaluating \ac{PX} allows assessing if a \ac{PREG} increases patientsâ€™ motivation towards a therapy. 

\ac{PX} is a complex concept that involves different actors, such as context, game system and players \autocite{Engl2013,Fernandez2008,Nackea2}. Additionally, a \ac{PREG} should be evaluated considering motivational and therapeutic goals since it should provide a compelling experience to patients while assisting a physical rehabilitation treatment. Therefore, evaluators may consider limitations imposed by the rehabilitation context when evaluating \c{PX} in the context of \acp{PREG}. Previous works on evaluating \acp{PREG} have employed methods to evaluate conventional software and entertaining games, and some rehabilitation measurement instruments \autocite{Brokaw2015,Burke2009,jansen2013serious,Ni2014,Seo2016,Wuest2014}. However, there is no a standardised model to evaluate \ac{PX} in \acp{PREG}. Also, little is known about how the therapeutic goal of \acp{PREG} may affect \ac{PX} and its evaluation. Understanding the constraints that the therapeutic goal of \acp{PREG} may impose to \ac{PX} is important for evaluators to perform proper evaluations. In this research work, a \ac{PX} evaluation model for \acp{PREG} is proposed considering current research in \ac{PX} and a set of constraints of \acp{PREG}.

\section{Problem Statement}

% Concentration in methods (how, when, which) (no aspects, no instruments) -> Integrative model
% criteria to select
% Evaluation based on evaluator xp
% when: planning evlaution and when comparing evaluations

\ac{PX} denotes the personal experience of playing digital games; thus, it involves a subjective perception of players \autocite{Wiemeyer2016,Chu2011}. Evaluating \ac{PX} consists in the observation and analysis of the interaction between players and games, applying methods from different fields, including usability, psychology, play testing \autocite{Wiemeyer2016}, gameplay metrics \autocite{Drachen2013} and physiological evaluation \autocite{Nacke2015}. A \ac{PX} evaluation might be useful to evaluate the effectiveness of a \ac{PREG} since it allows assessing aspects such as players' motivation, enjoyment or satisfaction. Therefore, \ac{PX} evaluation is a critical process to be included within the game development life cycle \autocite{Bernhaupt2015,McAllister2015,desurvire_methods_2013,Nacke2009}.

Additionally, \acp{PREG} have particular constraints imposed by the use of non-traditional devices (e.g., motion sensors) to enable interaction; the special needs of players/patients \autocite{Pirovano2016,Wiemeyer2015,Sinclair2007,Ni2014,Cameirao2010,Nijholt2008}; and the rehabilitation environment (e.g., physiotherapists may intervene during treatments) \autocite{Wiemeyer2015,Nijholt2008}. 

Nevertheless, there is no a general agreement about the \ac{PX} concept and how to evaluate it \autocite{Yanez-Gomez2017,Wiemeyer2016,Mueller2015}. Thus, \ac{PX} is evaluated based on evaluators experience and criteria, resulting in the difficulty to analyse and compare obtained results, and to replicate a certain evaluation. Also, evaluators may not consider the constraints of \acp{PREG} and concentrate on aspects such as motivation, enjoyment or usability \autocite{Brokaw2015,Ni2014,Cameirao2010,jansen2013serious}.

Therefore, the process of evaluating \ac{PX} in \acp{PREG} should be formalised. Accordingly, the research question to be addressed along this work is:

\begin{center} 
\emph{How can \ac{PX} evaluation be standardised in \acp{PREG}?}
\end{center}

%\section{Justification}\label{sec:problemJustfication}
% Comparative results
% evaluation planning objective

%The purpose of digital games is to provide a fun and engaging experience to players \autocite{Moosajee,Zammitto2014}. Meanwhile, serious games should provide a positive experience while achieving an additional goal; e.g., to train, educate or support a certain process \autocite{Wiemeyer2016}. Therefore, evaluating \ac{PX} has become a crucial process to be integrated along the game development life cycle since it allows assessing the effectiveness of a game to provide the expected experience \autocite{Bernhaupt2015,McAllister2015,desurvire_methods_2013,Nacke2009}. In this context, research fields like \ac{GUR} have evolved in the past years. \ac{GUR} encompasses concepts, methods, tools and techniques aimed to reach an optimal quality of \ac{PX}; i.e., create more compelling gameplay experiences \autocite{Moosajee,Nacke2015,Wiemeyer2016,Drachen2013}.

%An integral evaluation of \acp{PREG} should consider particular constraints. These constraints are mainly related to the use of motion sensors as mean of interaction \autocite{Wiemeyer2015,Nijholt2008} and the involved rehabilitation purpose. The effectiveness of a \ac{PREG} may be evaluated in terms of its capability to motivate patients and assist their rehabilitation therapy. A model for evaluating \ac{PX} in \acp{PREG} may contribute to address the lack of standardisation of this process and may be employed as a tool for validating the effectiveness objectively, guiding evaluators while performing an evaluation.
